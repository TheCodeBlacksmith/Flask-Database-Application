# Flask-Database-Application

Developed a functioning application for food truck companies where admins, managers and staff employees are able to access different aspects of a food truck information including menu items and food prices with information saved in an external MySQL database. The application is deployable in both Linux and Windows systems.

MySQL database access was achieved via a Python backend developed in Flask with a GUI developed as part of a website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the Visual Studio Code editor.
